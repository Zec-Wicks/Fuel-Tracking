# Fuel-Tracking
While this was initially planned to be a react native app, my personal hatred for CSS is too great, and as such, I have decided to stick with my roots, and utilise python for data analysis and visualisation. This project is a simple fuel tracking notebook, which will allow users to input their fuel usage, and track their fuel economy over time. The app will also provide users with a simple visualisation of their fuel economy among other statistics.
